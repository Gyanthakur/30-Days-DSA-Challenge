# Longest Palindromic Substring Solution Explanation

This code provides a solution to finding the longest palindromic substring within a given string `s`. A palindromic substring reads the same backward as forward.

### Algorithm Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The function starts by checking if the input string has a size of 1. If so, it directly returns the input string as the result, as any single character is a palindrome.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - It initializes a 2D boolean array `dp` of size `s.size() x s.size()`, where `dp[i][j]` is true if the substring from index `i` to index `j` in the input string `s` is a palindrome.

3. **Base Case:**
   - The algorithm initializes the main diagonal of the `dp` array (where `i == j`) to `true` because single characters are always palindromes.

4. **Palindromic Substring Check:**
   - The code then iterates over the input string, comparing characters at different positions.
   - If the characters at `i` and `j` are equal, it checks if the substring from `j + 1` to `i - 1` is also a palindrome (which is `dp[j + 1][i - 1]`).
   - If it's a palindrome, it marks `dp[j][i]` as `true`.
   - Additionally, it keeps track of the longest palindrome found so far and its starting and ending indices.

5. **Result Extraction:**
   - After the DP array is filled, the function extracts the longest palindromic substring using the starting and ending indices stored during the iteration.
   - It uses the `substr` function to extract the palindrome from the input string.

6. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it uses a nested loop to fill the DP table.

### Example:

For input string `"babad"`, the algorithm would fill the `dp` array as follows:
```
b a b a d
T F T F F
  T F T F
    T F F T
      T T F T
```
The longest palindromic substring is "bab".
